Atlas
=====

A whole world of documentation.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisui/atlas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lystable/atlas)

### What? :earth_africa:

zero-config, pretty, highly discoverable atlas of all your documentation.

Write your docs as usual close to their relevant components and then generate from any* level!
 
**Works great with monorepos!*

### How? :earth_asia:

Conventions! No config.

Anything under a `docs` directory (anywhere) is consumed

- Special `README.md` file can live as a sibling to `docs` (it acts as the index file)
- Special treatment of `.md`, `.js` and `.html` files
  - Write `.md` as if it was just living in GitHub
  - Write `.js` exporting a React component to render
  - Write `.html` as far as your imagination takes you
- Other files are discoverable (eg. `.png`, `.pdf` etc.)
- Underscore prefixed `_files.ext` and `_dirs` are ignored
- If you reference files outside of `docs` we'll pull those in too!
- More special files to provide as much meta data in your docs as we can and reduce duplication
  - `package.json`
  - `LICENSE.x`

How do I customise anything?

- `_layout.js`

### More! :earth_americas:

- Awesome search capabilities
- Pull in contributors to each documentation file
- First-class Github support
